# ash-factorial
The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.
For example, the factorial of 6 (denoted as 6!) is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720. 
Factorial is not defined for negative numbers and the factorial of zero is one, 0! = 1.
Here, we take input from the user and check if the number is negative, zero or positive using if...else statement. 
If the number is positive, we use for loop to calculate the factorial. We can also use the built-in function factorial() for this.
